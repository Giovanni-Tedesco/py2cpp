# pybind11 Presentation

## What is Pybind11
- Pybind11 is a header only library for c++
- It exposes C++ types in python and vice versa
- Aims to replace boost for a similar task while being much smaller in overall size

## Why?
- As part of BF2 goals we aim to find a way to translate between c++ and python and pybind11 offers a solution for that
- It also gives good insights into the type of end-goal that we could aim to achieve when implementing our own solution for this
